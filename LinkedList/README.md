## What is Linked List ?

- linear datastructure 
- elements are arranged in sequential way

## Opeartions in Linked List
- insert at end
- insert at begin
- insert at index
- delete at end
- delete at begin
- delete at index
- show

## Basic Concepts

- A Node consists of two fields:-
    - data -> consists value
    - next -> consists address

- Here field "next" consists address of next Node.Then only link is made.

- The last node always contains null in the "next" field.

## Difference between Arrays and LinkedList ?

- The manipulations can be done easily in linkedlist whereas in arrays it is difficult.
- Linkedlist is slower compared to array. This is because we have to traverse the address of each node to reach the certain node. This is slightly time consuming process.
